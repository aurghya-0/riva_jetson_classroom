# Project Name: ClassNotesGenerator

## Overview
The ClassNotesGenerator is a project aimed at revolutionizing the way students take notes in class by automating the process of transcribing, summarizing, and organizing class lectures. It leverages cutting-edge technologies, including OpenAI Whisper for voice transcription and OpenAI GPT-4.0 or Google Gemini for language modeling, to create concise and informative class notes.

## Features
- **Voice Transcription:** Utilize OpenAI Whisper or Nvidia Riva for accurate and efficient transcription of teacher lectures recorded in voice format.
- **Language Modeling:** Leverage the power of OpenAI GPT-4.0 or Google Gemini to process the transcriptions, providing advanced language understanding and context-aware summarization.
- **Summarization:** Automatically generate summaries of class lectures, distilling key information and concepts for efficient review.
- **Topic Extraction:** Identify and extract important topics from the summarized content to create a collection of organized class notes.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy interaction and customization.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Store and manage class notes data efficiently using MongoDB.
